      "2 Sam's and a Rohan is a website that allows users to place orders from a menu, and it allows the restaurant to respond to said orders. The website allows users to add menu items to a cart and place the order. When placing the order, a user must input their phone number. Placing the order will send the restaurant an SMS message notifying them that the order has been placed. On the restaurant end, there is a portal that allows owners to view incoming orders. For new orders, it allows the owner to insert the time in minutes, indicating how long it would take for an order to finish. When the order is complete, the user would recieve a message on their phone. A 'pending' order will include a timer showing how long an order will take to finish. Once the order is finished, the user recieves a completion message.",
