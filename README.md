# Portfolio
This is a portfolio website showcasing all the projects I've made so far. It was created using React, Bootstrap, several Node libraries and has been deployed through Netlify.

Here are the working links as of writing:
- https://rohanvarughese.com/
- https://rohan-varughese.netlify.app/

When making the webpage, I tried to make it so I can easily add details of a new project by simply copy-pasting an existing JS file, and replacing it with info about the new project. This is to make it as easy as possible to continually add new projects.
